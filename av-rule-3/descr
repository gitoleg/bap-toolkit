All functions shall have a cyclomatic complexity number of 20 or less

Cyclomatic complexity is a metric that is used to determine a
number of linearly independent paths in a program.

In our case, we compute cyclomatic complexity for each subroutine
by applying the next formula to it's control flow graph:
  C = E - N + P
where E is a number of edges, N is a number of nodes and P is
a number of a strongly connected components.
