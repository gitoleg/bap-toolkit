The goto statement shall not be used

This rule means that a control flow graph of each subroutine
should be reducible. Or, as vice versa, there should not be
any subroutine with non-reducible control flow graph.

The CFG is considered as a reducible one if if doesn'y contain
strongly connected components with two and more entries.
