The signal handling facilities of <signal.h> shall not be used


Checks the program for a usage of the next functions defined in the file <signal.h>:
  - signal
  - raise

The algorithm is pretty straightforward: we check the input edges for every subroutine
in the program callgraph, and if there are some then the subroutine is considered as a used one,
i.e. there is at least one call of the given subroutine.
