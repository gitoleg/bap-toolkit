The library functions atof, atoi and atol from library <stdlib.h> shall not be used


Checks the program for a usage of the next functions defined in the file <stdlib.h>:
 - atof
 - atoi
 - atol

The algorithm is pretty straightforward: we check the input edges for every subroutine
in the program callgraph, and if there are some then the subroutine is considered as a used one,
i.e. there is at least one call of the given subroutine.
