The time handling functions of library <time.h> shall not be used

Checks the program for a usage of the next functions defined in the file <time.h>:
  - asctime
  - clock
  - ctime
  - difftime
  - gmtime
  - localtime
  - mktime
  - strftime
  - time

The algorithm is pretty straightforward: we check the input edges for every subroutine
in the program callgraph, and if there are some then the subroutine is considered as a used one,
i.e. there is at least one call of the given subroutine.
