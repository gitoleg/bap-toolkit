detects unused values returned by functions

The algotihm uses function's api information to determine it's output argument.
Value assigned to the output argument becomes a source of a taint.
And any read of the tainted value sanitizes this taint, meaning that
an output argument is actually used.
Otherwise, if the taint survives and is finalized by garbage collector,
then a proof of unused result is obtainted.

All checks are reported:
- to stdout in the user friendly format
- via the incident report system and are stored
in the working directory in the `unused-result.incidents' file.
The file could be loaded in IDA Pro for further analysis.
