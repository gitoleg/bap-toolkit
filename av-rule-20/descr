The setjmp macro and the longjmp function shall not be used

Checks the program for a usage of the next functions defined in the file <setjmp.h>:
  - setjmp
  - longjmp

The algorithm is pretty straightforward: we check the input edges for every subroutine
in the program callgraph, and if there are some then the subroutine is considered as a used one,
i.e. there is at least one call of the given subroutine.
